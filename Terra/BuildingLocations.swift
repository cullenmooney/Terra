Michigan Ave.", addressTwo: "Chicago, IL 60611", architect: "Graham, Anderson, Probst & White", year: "1924", image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "wrigley"), design: "With its triparite base and cathedral tower, the Wrigley Building reflects European classical tradition. Most of the building is covered with terra-cotta tiles glazed in white, which are magnificently lit at night; because the tiles are graded from off-white to bluish, the building appears to grow brighter as the eye moves up the tower. Construction of the southern building was completed before the northern lot was bought, but the buildings complement each other in design and style.")]

Murphy Associates", year: "1964", image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "daleycenter"), design: "Made of Cor-Ten, a self-weathering steel developed around 1930, the Richard J. Daley Center houses 120 courtrooms, a library, and offices. Like the buildings designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the Daley Center's exterior exposes its internal structure. Built from trusses, each structural bay is 87 feet long and about 48 feet wide, creating 31 stories at a height of 650 feet. A Cor-Ten sculpture designed by Pablo Picasso is exhibited in the plaza on the south side of the building.")]

Addison St.", addressTwo: "Chicago, IL 60613", architect: "Zachary Taylor Davis", year: "1914", image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "wrigleyfield"), design: "The oldest surviving National League ballpark and the hoe to the Chicago Cubs professional baseball team, Wrigley Field is one of the few remaining ballparks built in baseball's 'golden age,' 1910-1925. During that period, permanent materials such as steel, brick, and concrete were used, as well as post-and-beam construction, which allowed fans to be closer to the field. Zachary Taylor Davis also designed Chicago's original Comiskey Park (home to the White Sox), which has since been demolished. Wrigley Field's nickname, 'the friendly confines,' originates in part from its ivy-covered walls and hand-operated scoreboard. In its urban setting, surrounded by homes where fans gather on rooftops to watch their team, it feels like an old-time ballpark.")]

The building included everything a city dweller needed: shopping, entertainment (theater, restaurants, art gallery, bowling alley, skating rink, swimming pool, and exercise club), a marina, and office and residential spaces, including a spiral parking garage. Constructed from the core outward, the 60-story cast concrete towers were successful from the beginning. Pie-shaped apartments above the 18-story parking garage provide a panoramic view of the city.")]

Its grand neoclassical central hall, surrounded by Ionic columns, is filled with equally grand artifacts including elephants, dinosaurs, and totem poles. In 1976, the landmark building was placed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Field Museum is part of the Grant Park Museum Complex along the shores of Lake Michigan, called by historian Carl Condit 'architecturally the most impressive 'cultural center' in the United States.'")]

The design recalls ancient Greek and Roman areans, with Doric columns rising 100 feet above the arena. Constructed of concrete and faced with granite-textured cast stone, the stadium is used for religious events, concerts, and sporting events, serving as home for the NFL's Chicago Bears football team.")]

Nine 75-foot-square tubes rise from a concrete slab resting on steel and concrete caissons that extend to bedrock 65 feet below the building's three subbasements. Two of the tubes end on the fiftieth floor, two end on the sixty-sixth floor, three end on the ninetieth floor, and two extend to the top of the building. This staggered ending of support tubes creates the steplike appearance of the building's exterior and provides the strength needed to withstand Chicago's gusty winds. Materials included steel and concrete with an exterior of black aluminum and glistening burnished glass. At 1,454 feet (110 stories), the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) was the world's tallest building until April 1996.")]

Set on 20,000 wooden piles and, at the time, the world's largest pier, it was a successful freight and passenger terminal until the Great Depression, when shipping traffic decreased. the pier was used a naval training center during World War II and as the University of Illinois's Chicago campus from 1946 to 1965. In 1976, the ballroom was restored and pier was again used for civic and cultural events. In 1989, the city and state financed further renovations, including provision of space for conferences and expositions, museums, shops, restaurants, and entertainment and recreational facilities.")]

Theatergoers enter under a triumphal arch with neobaroque-style detailing. The addition of a marquee and six-story vertical sign partially hid the arch and its decoration, but the lobby's interior provides a full view of the extravagant Second Empire-style hallways and alcoves. The unique design of the 3,800-seat auditorium permits an unobscured view of the stage for all audience members. Featuring live performances and movies, the Chicago Theatre's entertainment roster has included Buster Keaton, Sally Rand, Will Rogers, Al Jolson, Milton Berle, Jack Benny, Martin and Lewis, Bo Diddley, and Savion Glover.")]
